# Storm Chasing Website - All-In-0ne storm chasing website

I built this with different AI models and my little expeirence with node.js. I am getting started into chasing and would love to see this program grow. Feel free to submit a issue with a major request that would make this program alot better and I'll see if I want to add the change.

Program is built with node.js, install it at your own will, if you don't know and can't learn to google / chatgpt how to install it then you probably shouldn't.

I would love to see pull requests from people that are smarter then me!
